# Configuration file for libinput-gestures.
#
# The default configuration file exists at /etc/libinput-gestures.conf
# but a user can create a personal custom configuration file at
# ~/.config/libinput-gestures.conf.
#
# Lines starting with '#' and blank lines are ignored.
# At present only gesture lines are configured in this file.
#
# Each gesture: line has 3 [or 4] arguments:
#
# action motion [finger_count] command
#
# where action and motion is either:
#     swipe up
#     swipe down
#     swipe left
#     swipe right
#     pinch in
#     pinch out
#
# command is the remainder of the line and is any valid shell command +
# arguments.
#
# finger_count is optional (and is typically 3 or 4). If specified then
# the command is executed when exactly that number of fingers is used in
# the gesture. If not specified then the command is executed when that
# gesture is executed with any number of fingers. Gesture lines
# specified with finger_count have priority over the same gesture
# specified without any finger_count.
#
# Typically command will be xdotool, or wmctrl. See "man xdotool" for
# the many things you can action with that tool. Note that unfortunately
# xdotool does not work with native Wayland clients.
#
# Note the default is an "internal" command that uses wmctrl to switch
# workspaces and, unlike xdotool, works on both Xorg and Wayland (via
# XWayland). It also can be configured for vertical and horizontal
# switching over tabular workspaces, as per the example below. You can
# also add "-w" to the internal command to allow wrapping workspaces.

# GNOME SHELL move to next workspace (works for GNOME on Wayland and Xorg)
gesture: swipe up	_internal ws_up
#gesture: swipe up	xdotool key super+Page_Down
gesture: swipe right 4	_internal ws_down

# GNOME SHELL move to prev workspace (works for GNOME on Wayland and Xorg)
gesture: swipe down	_internal ws_down
#gesture: swipe down	xdotool key super+Page_Up
gesture: swipe left 4	_internal ws_up

# GNOME/Browser go forward (works only for Xorg, and Xwayland clients)
gesture: swipe left 3	xdotool key alt+Left

# GNOME/Browser go back (works only for Xorg, and Xwayland clients)
gesture: swipe right 3	xdotool key alt+Right

# Example of 8 static workspaces, e.g. using KDE virtual-desktops,
# arranged in 2 rows of 4 across using swipe up/down/left/right to
# navigate in fixed planes. Must match how you have configured your
# virtual desktops.
#gesture: swipe up	_internal --col=2 ws_up
#gesture: swipe down	_internal --col=2 ws_down
#gesture: swipe left	_internal --row=4 ws_up
#gesture: swipe right	_internal --row=4 ws_down

# GNOME SHELL open/close overview (works for GNOME on Wayland and Xorg)
gesture: pinch in dbus-send --session --type=method_call --dest=org.gnome.Shell /org/gnome/Shell org.gnome.Shell.Eval string:'Main.overview.toggle();'

gesture: pinch out dbus-send --session --type=method_call --dest=org.gnome.Shell /org/gnome/Shell org.gnome.Shell.Eval string:'Main.overview.toggle();'
